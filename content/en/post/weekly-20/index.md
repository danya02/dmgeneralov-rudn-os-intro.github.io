This is a weekly post that is required by the rules for maintaining a personal project. This post was written on May 20, 2022, and covers week 20, 2022.

# How was the week

During the week, one of the non-standard circumstances was the control work on the subject "programming technology", where it was necessary to implement some operations on lists and arrays.
This was somewhat complicated by the fact that the results of the work had to be written on paper.

# Key insights

- Depending on the transmission medium used, the uptime of systems can be much more or much less than the uptime of communication lines - in the case of a cellular network, the systems reboot more often, and in the case of Wi-Fi, the link itself reboots more often.

- The OpenWRT configuration interface does not support specifying specific DHCP server directives, and they may need to be set through manual editing of configuration files

- The sampling rate at which an oscilloscope operates can have a disproportionate effect on the signal content it measures.

# Main insight

```c
!( sizeof(long long) > sizeof(long) )
```


# What failed to do

I did not have time to do a full-fledged comparative analysis of 3D printers, which is necessary to determine the most rational choice for our project.

# Work on mistakes

As before, you need to create a stable task scheduling scheme that would not be disturbed by small changes from the schedule, as well as create a backlog of tasks so that they can be effectively scheduled, delegated or postponed.

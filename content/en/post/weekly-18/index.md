This is a weekly post that is required by the rules for maintaining a personal project. This post was written on May 7, 2022, and covers week 18, 2022.

# How was the week

Overall, week 18 was similar to week 17, and both were more productive than week 16.
This is because the format of this course is still unfamiliar and goes against my previous experience.
Therefore, according to the sensations, it turned out only to do the work at the rate of the OS and nothing more useful.

# Key insights

- The AVR architecture has three system timers. The first one is usually used for real time tracking, the second one for precise PWM signals, and the third one for approximate PWM signals.
- As before, the model of reality based on the theory of complete determinism with the addition of randomness through quantum mechanics seems to be the most accurate description of reality.
- The video game The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe (2022) puts forward a model of reality based on the central thesis that everything (with the possible exception of the narrator and the player character) is a bucket, and therefore any attempt to limit the number of buckets in the world inevitably leads to the destruction of the world in the current understanding. This model must be carefully considered by the engineers of metaphysics to determine its scope.

# Main insight

With the understanding that all timing in the AVR is done with three timers, it is now possible to write code that connects one of the timers to the pins on the chip, allowing you to implement PWM signals from scratch as part of the Rust Arduino environment project.

# What failed to do

As in weeks 16 and 17, there is a feeling that almost nothing can be done from the plans. This feeling is based on the fact that the work on the OS course takes a very long time and requires full concentration (due to the fact that the video is being recorded), and after completing one stage, it is difficult to convince yourself to do the next. It basically boils down to the fact that I have not yet developed a stable strategy for allocating work and rest time, which, combined with the drastic change in the load profile, leads to this feeling of lack of progress.

# Work on mistakes

In order to solve the above problems, the most promising solution is to develop task allocation schemes that are comfortable enough for everyday use and that allow active tasks to be solved more efficiently.

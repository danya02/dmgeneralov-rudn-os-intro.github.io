This is a weekly post that is required by the rules for maintaining a personal project. This post was written on May 28, 2022, and hides the 21st week of 2022.

# How was the week

Although there are some demands to justify the costs incurred, nevertheless the verdict follows that the result is worth it.

# Key insights

- If two display managers are not designed to cooperate, then switching between them can change most of the graphical settings.

- A standard Internet connection in Moscow, oriented to TCP traffic, and transmits a large amount of ICMP traffic, may lead to loss of connection.

- using the current economic situation, disk storage collects expensive information. After completing this project, you should delete its files.

# Main insight

The end is never the end is never the end is never the end is never the end is never the end is never.

# What failed to do

Dedicated time is required to learn the basics of CAD design and develop the details to work on a project.

# Work on mistakes

With the completion of this project, it may be possible to abandon the cycle schedule and start a new one.

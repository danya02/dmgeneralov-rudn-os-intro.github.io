This is a weekly post that is required by the rules for maintaining a personal project. This post was written on May 14, 2022, and covers week 19, 2022.

# How was the week

It is impossible to provide special important reports for this week, as well as for the previous one.
This is because we are now in a cycle of work that seems to be endless, and it is becoming more and more difficult to tell one week from the next.

# Key insights

- Macros in Rust should have a form in which, even without expanding the macro, the code represents a valid syntax tree. This distinguishes them from macros in C/C++, where they only perform text replacement.

- The amount of disk space occupied by video recordings of work in progress exceeds the usefulness of these videos by several orders of magnitude. Under the current circumstances, the amount used for these videos should be reduced.

- The use of Rutube - the Russian platform - in industrial activities is contraindicated, since it is not able to withstand the SLA that can be expected from alternative platforms.

# Main insight

As part of this personal project, we learn how to find ways to optimize work. These methods sometimes lead to lower quality, but following the classic trichotomy of requirements, we can sacrifice this for the greater good.

# What failed to do

Fairly poor progress on a robotics project that was assigned to me in an elective course. One of the main reasons for this is that the power supply of the robot consists of 18650 batteries, and the ones that are available to me are quite broken.

# Work on mistakes

As before, you need to create a stable task scheduling scheme that would not be disturbed by small changes from the schedule, as well as create a backlog of tasks so that they can be effectively scheduled, delegated or postponed.

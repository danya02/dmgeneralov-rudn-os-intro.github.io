This is a weekly post that is required by the rules for maintaining a personal project. This post was written on May 28, 2022, and covers 21 weeks of 2022.

# How was the week

By all accounts, there are only a few weeks left until the end of this module. This circumstance was surprising to many, including me, who began to perceive what was happening as their personal hell.

# Key insights

- The level of energy contained in the vault very often does not affect the structure of the vault itself, but can affect the environment if the vault is disturbed.

- Lithium-ion batteries should be at a medium charge level in transit to minimize the risk of spontaneous combustion.

- USB devices can have up to 16 different virtual devices called "endpoints". Protocols between them should not be unified.

# Main insight

Works - do not touch.


# What failed to do

I still haven't had time to do a full-fledged comparative analysis of 3D printers, which is necessary to determine the most rational choice for our project.
This should be done as soon as possible.

# Work on mistakes

As before, you need to create a stable task scheduling scheme that would not be disturbed by small changes from the schedule, as well as create a backlog of tasks so that they can be effectively scheduled, delegated or postponed.
